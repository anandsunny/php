Variable defination -

    Think of variables as containers for storing data.
    In PHP, a variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable.
    
 note : Unlike other programming languages, PHP has no command for declaring a variable. It is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
 
 
 
 Rules for PHP variables:

    A variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable
    A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
    A variable name cannot start with a number
    A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
    Variable names are case-sensitive ($age and $AGE are two different variables)
    
    note: Remember that PHP variable names are case-sensitive!
    
    
 PHP is a Loosely Typed Language

   We do not have to tell PHP which data type the variable is.
   PHP automatically converts the variable to the correct data type, depending on its value.
   In other languages such as C, C++, and Java, the programmer must declare the name and type of the variable before using it.


 PHP Variables Scope
    In PHP, variables can be declared anywhere in the script.

    The scope of a variable is the part of the script where the variable can be referenced/used.

    PHP has three different variable scopes:

    local
    global
    static
